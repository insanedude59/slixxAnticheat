## 	Setup instructions are as below.
	1. Go to the RemoteEvent named 'a2' and parent it to ReplicatedStorage.
	2. Go to the LocalScript CL and parent them to StarterPlayerScripts. The LocalScript will automatically be destroyed from StarterPlayerScripts upon joining to prevent it from being seen.
	2. (Optional, but recommended) Configure the anticheat settings as you wish by going to AnticheatSettings. Explanations of the settings are in there.
	
	That is all, you are done!
